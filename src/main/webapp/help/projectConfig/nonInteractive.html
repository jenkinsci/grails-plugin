	Many targets may prompt the user interactively for input.  This is almost never what you want to happen when building
	in an automated unattended environment like Hudson.  Turning this option on will cause &quot;--non-interactive&quot; to
	be appended to all Grails commands that are executed as part of this build which will suppress all interactive prompts.
